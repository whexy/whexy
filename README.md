### To Judgers

I have a free and useless soul. If you have time, I can read a little poem translated by myself.

```
I want to waste time with you, looking down at the fish
Leaving the teapot on the table
Wasting their nice shadows

I want to waste the sunset too, by ambling
Until the stars spill across the sky
I want to waste the wind
Sitting on the ground, watching the dark clouds in your eyes
Being blown out the window

I've wasted the world as it passes me by
Tired and never loved
But I'll do it tomorrow, wasted
All the flowers, life should be as beautiful as they were

And as meaningless as they were, like the movies I wasted
Those of desperate love and death
Bring us brief moments of silence

I want to waste them with you
Brief silences, long meaningful or meaninglessness
The subtle and ancient universe
Leaning against the fence, looking down at the mirror made of water

Until all that is wasted
grows wings behind us.
```

#### To Judgers:

我空有自由且无用的灵魂。送你一首小诗。

我想和你虚度时光 / 李元胜

我想和你虚度时光，比如低头看鱼
比如把茶杯留在桌子上，离开
浪费它们好看的阴影
我还想连落日一起浪费，比如散步
一直消磨到星光满天
我还要浪费风起的时候
坐在走廊发呆，直到你眼中乌云
全部被吹到窗外
我已经虚度了世界，它经过我
疲倦，又像从未被爱过
但是明天我还要这样，虚度
满目的花草，生活应该像它们一样美好
一样无意义，像被虚度的电影
那些绝望的爱和赴死
为我们带来短暂的沉默
我想和你互相浪费
一起虚度短的沉默，长的无意义
一起消磨精致而苍老的宇宙
比如靠在栏杆上，低头看水的镜子
直到所有被虚度的事物
在我们身后，长出薄薄的翅膀
```
