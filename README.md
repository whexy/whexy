### To Judgers

I have a free and useless soul. If you have time, I can read a little poem translated by myself.

```
I want to waste time with you, looking down at the fishes
Leaving the teapots on the table
Wasting their good looking shadows

I also want to waste the sunset, by amble
Until the starlight taking the sky
I want to waste the wind
Sitting on the ground, watching the dark clouds in your eyes
are blowed outside the window

I have already wasted the world, as it past me
Tired, never been loved
But I am still going to do this tomorrow, wasting
All the flowers, life should be as beautiful as they were

And as meaningless as they were, like the movie I wasted
Those desperate love and death
Bringing us a short silence

I want to waste them all with you
The short silence, the long meaning or meaninglessness
The subtle, old universe
Lying on the fence, looking down at the mirror made by water

Until all the wasted stuff
Growing wings behind us.
```

#### To Judgers:

我空有自由且无用的灵魂。送你一首小诗。

我想和你虚度时光 / 李元胜

我想和你虚度时光，比如低头看鱼
比如把茶杯留在桌子上，离开
浪费它们好看的阴影
我还想连落日一起浪费，比如散步
一直消磨到星光满天
我还要浪费风起的时候
坐在走廊发呆，直到你眼中乌云
全部被吹到窗外
我已经虚度了世界，它经过我
疲倦，又像从未被爱过
但是明天我还要这样，虚度
满目的花草，生活应该像它们一样美好
一样无意义，像被虚度的电影
那些绝望的爱和赴死
为我们带来短暂的沉默
我想和你互相浪费
一起虚度短的沉默，长的无意义
一起消磨精致而苍老的宇宙
比如靠在栏杆上，低头看水的镜子
直到所有被虚度的事物
在我们身后，长出薄薄的翅膀
```
